## by (Bernard Kula)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.I dropped all rows that had null values before I started my exploration.


## Summary of Findings

> The starting station has minimal effect on the trip duration.<br>
> The end station has minimal effect on the trip duration.<br>
> The birth year has significant impact on the trip duration as depicted on the visualization the longest trips where taken by members born in 1970 and later.<br>
> Gender has a significant impact on the trip duration has seen from the visualization more males than attained higher trip durations than females and other genders.<br>
> There seems to be an even distribution of trip duration among the two user types.<br>


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The customers user type had an higher trip duration than the subscibers user type across all the genders. This should inform the organization on where to put more efforts on marketing and also which user type to concentrate on for business continuity.
